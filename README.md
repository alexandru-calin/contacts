# Contacts

This is a simple single-page application that lets you create, edit and delete contacts.<br>
It uses React Router to handle client-side routing.

I built this to learn the main concepts of React Router.

### Built With

[![Stack](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=react,bootstrap)](https://skillicons.dev)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Git - [Download & Install Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
- Node.js - [Download & Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and the npm package manager.

### Installation

1. Clone this repository

```
git clone https://github.com/alexandru-calin/contacts.git
```

2. Install the dependencies in the application folder

```
cd contacts
npm install
```

## Usage

### `npm run dev`

Runs the application in development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) to view it in the browser.

The page will automatically reload if you make changes to the code.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.<br>

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
